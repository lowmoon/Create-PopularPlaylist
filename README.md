# Create-PopularPlaylist

A script to create a Spotify playlist of the most popular songs (by listen count) of an artist or lists of artists

The first two variables - $clientID and $ArtistList - must be manually changed. The $clientID variable is your Spotify API clientID. The $ArtistList variable is a path to a file containing a list of artists. If you comment out the $AristList variable, you will be prompted to enter a single artist when the script runs.
